# portrait_mode

My attempt to create something like Pixel phones portrait mode using Flutter and Tensorflow's DeepLab model.

## Getting Started

Clone this project and don't forget to get packages.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Things to consider

This project isn't optimized at all and it takes a lot of time to process the photo. Durinng the image processing an error will appear from nowhere but the photo is going to be processed anyway.

I would appreciate if you tell me how to improve the code and how can I add the Bokeh effect instead of Gaussing blur.
